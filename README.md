# amv-ffmpeg

WARNING: I have not gotten this to produce an .amv which I could successfully play yet on my US212C MP3/AMV player by [Actions-Semi](https://www.actions-semi.com/index.php?siteId=4) ([Chinese/native version, you might have better luck translating with your browser](https://www.actions-semi.com)). If you get it to work, PLEASE OPEN AN ISSUE OR PR EXPLAINING HOW YOU DID SO. Thanks

I am releasing a prebuilt binary of this. I couldn't get it to build correctly without passing `--disable-mmx` to `./configure`, so I don't know if that does anything...

Again, let me know if you have better luck than I did!
